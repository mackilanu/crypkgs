.TH MANPATH 5 2024-04-05 2.12.1 /etc/man_db.conf
.SH NAVN
manpath \- format for filen /etc/man_db.conf
.SH BESKRIVELSE
The manpath configuration file is used by the manual page utilities to
assess users' manpaths at run time, to indicate which manual page
hierarchies (manpaths) are to be treated as system hierarchies and to assign
them directories to be used for storing cat files.

If the environment variable $\fBMANPATH\fP is already set, the information
contained within /etc/man_db.conf will not override it.
.SH "SEARCH PATH"
By default, man\-db examines the user's $\fBPATH\fP.  For each \fIpath_element\fP
found there, it adds \fImanpath_element\fP to the search path.

If there is no \fBMANPATH_MAP\fP line in the configuration file for a given
\fIpath_element\fP, then it adds all of \fIpath_element/../man\fP,
\fIpath_element/man\fP, \fIpath_element/../share/man\fP, and
\fIpath_element/share/man\fP that exist as directories to the search path.

It then adds any \fBMANDATORY_MANPATH\fP entries from the configuration file to
the search path.

Finally, if the \fB\-\-systems\fP option is used or the $\fBSYSTEM\fP environment
variable is set, then that should consist of a sequence of operating system
names separated by commas or colons.  This acts as a template, expanding the
search path once more to allow access to other operating systems' manual
pages: for each system name, man\-db looks for that name as a subdirectory of
each entry in the search path, and adds it to the final search path if it
exists.  A system name of \fBman\fP inserts the normal search path without
subdirectories.  For example, if the search path would otherwise have been
\fI/usr/share/man:/usr/local/man\fP, and $\fBSYSTEM\fP is set to \fInewOS:man\fP,
then the final search path will be
\fI/usr/share/man/newOS:/usr/share/man:/usr/local/man/newOS:/usr/local/man\fP.

The $\fBMANPATH\fP environment variable overrides man\-db's default manual page
search paths.  Most users should not need to set it.  Its syntax is similar
to the $\fBPATH\fP environment variable: it consists of a sequence of directory
names separated by colons.  It overrides the default search path described
above.

If the value of $\fBMANPATH\fP starts with a colon, then the default search
path is added at its start.  If the value of $\fBMANPATH\fP ends with a colon,
then the default search path is added at its end.  If the value of
$\fBMANPATH\fP contains a double colon (\fB::\fP), then the default search path is
inserted in the middle of the value, between the two colons.
.SH FORMAT
De følgende felttyper genkendes i øjeblikket:
.TP 
\fB#\fP\fI\ kommentar\fP
Tomme linjer eller dem som begynder med \fB#\fP vil blive opfattet som
kommentarer og ignoreret.
.TP 
\fBMANDATORY_MANPATH\fP\fI\ manualstielement\fP
Lines of this form indicate manpaths that every automatically generated
$\fBMANPATH\fP should contain.  This will typically include \fI/usr/man\fP.
.TP 
\fBMANPATH_MAP\fP\fI\ stielement\ manualstielement\fP
Lines of this form set up $\fBPATH\fP to $\fBMANPATH\fP mappings.  For each
\fIpath_element\fP found in the user's $\fBPATH\fP, \fImanpath_element\fP will be
added to the $\fBMANPATH\fP.
.TP 
\fBMANDB_MAP \fP\fImanpath_element \fP\|[\| \fIcatpath_element\fP \|]
Lines of this form indicate which manpaths are to be treated as system
manpaths, and optionally where their cat files should be stored.  This field
type is particularly important if \fBman\fP is a setuid program, as (when in
the system configuration file /etc/man_db.conf rather than the per\-user
configuration file .manpath)  it indicates which manual page hierarchies to
access as the setuid user and which as the invoking user.

Systemets manualsidehierarkier er normalt dem, der lagres under \fI/usr\fP
såsom \fI/usr/man\fP, \fI/usr/local/man\fP og \fI/usr/X11R6/man\fP.

If cat pages from a particular \fImanpath_element\fP are not to be stored or
are to be stored in the traditional location, \fIcatpath_element\fP may be
omitted.

Traditional cat placement would be impossible for read only mounted manual
page hierarchies and because of this it is possible to specify any valid
directory hierarchy for their storage.  To observe the \fBLinux FSSTND\fP the
keyword \fBFSSTND\fP can be used in place of an actual directory.

Unfortunately, it is necessary to specify \fBall\fP system man tree paths,
including alternate operating system paths such as \fI/usr/man/sun\fP and any
\fBNLS locale\fP paths such as \fI/usr/man/de_DE.88591\fP.

As the information is parsed line by line in the order written, it is
necessary for any manpath that is a sub\-hierarchy of another hierarchy to be
listed first, otherwise an incorrect match will be made.  An example is that
\fI/usr/man/de_DE.88591\fP must come before \fI/usr/man\fP.
.TP 
\fBDEFINER\fP\fI\ nøgle\ værdi\fP
Lines of this form define miscellaneous configuration variables; see the
default configuration file for those variables used by the manual pager
utilities.  They include default paths to various programs (such as \fIgrep\fP
and \fItbl\fP), and default sets of arguments to those programs.
.TP 
\fBAFSNIT\fP \fIafsnit\fP .\|.\|.
.RS
Lines of this form define the order in which manual sections should be
searched.  If there are no \fBSECTION\fP directives in the configuration file,
the default is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
.if  !'po4a'hide' SECTION 1 n l 8 3 0 2 3type 5 4 9 6 7
.fi
.RE
.PP
If multiple \fBSECTION\fP directives are given, their section lists will be
concatenated.
.PP
If a particular extension is not in this list (say, 1mh) it will be
displayed with the rest of the section it belongs to.  The effect of this is
that you only need to explicitly list extensions if you want to force a
particular order.  Sections with extensions should usually be adjacent to
their main section (e.g. "1 1mh 8 ...").
.PP
\fBAFSNIT\fP accepteres som et alternativt navn for dette direktiv.
.RE
.TP 
\fBMINCATWIDTH\fP\fI\ bredde\fP
Hvis terminalbredden er mindre end \fIbredde\fP vil katalogsider ikke blive
oprettet (hvis manglende) eller vist. Standarden er 80.
.TP 
\fBMAXCATWIDTH\fP\fI\ bredde\fP
Hvis terminalbredden er større end \fIbredde\fP vil katalogsider ikke blive
oprettet (hvis manglende) eller vist. Standarden er 80.
.TP 
\fBCATWIDTH\fP\fI\ bredde\fP
If \fIwidth\fP is non\-zero, cat pages will always be formatted for a terminal
of the given width, regardless of the width of the terminal actually being
used.  This overrides \fBMINCATWIDTH\fP and \fBMAXCATWIDTH\fP.
.TP 
.if  !'po4a'hide' .B NOCACHE
Dette flag forhindrer \fBman\fP(1) i at oprette katalogsider automatisk.
.SH FEJL
Hvis reglerne anført ovenfor ikke følges præcist, vil redskaberne for
manualtekstviseren ikke fungere som ønsket. Reglerne er alt for kompliceret.
